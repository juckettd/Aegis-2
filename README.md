The Aegis 2 Handheld with a 7" screen

This is still a WIP.

Both the config and teensy controller files need updating and won't really work as they are now. I am in the process of updating both of these right now. Also the case and circuit boards have newer versions that I need to upload but if you want to download what I have right now go ahead.
